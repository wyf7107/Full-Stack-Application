For the convinence of grading here is how my project meet all requirements xD:

1. Project idea: The idea behind this project is to help users find place of interest around a certain location. It uses Fcebook Api 
  for login, Google Geolocaiton Api for finding the langtitude and latitiude of an address, and Google Place Api for finding place
  of intrests around given locations.
  
2. Application runs during in-class demo. It does!:D

3.Api keys are writtien in the fig file, and all calls to the api are from back end.

4.REST interface is correctly implemented in back-end routes: Front end calls back-end server (createuser.js) route which in turn calls REST interface
  So no api keys can be found in front end.
  
5. Routes are in their own files(using app.use('/',route))

6. Google APIs and facebook apis are called from the server (using http.get)

7. Angular used for front end

8. Ouath works for both locally and using facebook. the locationPlace (FindAttractions tab) and user profile page is protected only
    when the user is logged in.

9. MongoDb used for local user storage

10. Code is commented.
